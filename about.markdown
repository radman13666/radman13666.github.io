## Three words: Kind, Intelligent, Hard working

Hi there. I'm William Kibirango a.k.a the Rad Wolfsdragon. I'm a simple guy who likes to tinker with computers when not playing drums.

I recently got into ethical hacking and cybersecurity and I love it. So I try my best to learn all that I can and would love to meet like-minded people to hack with.

I love rock music and it's what led me to love playing drums, since March 2015. It makes me happy and energized. I hope to meet more people to talk and play drums with all day also.

If you'd like, check out my various online profiles and send me an email if you'd like to talk.

Stay cool, stay you.
